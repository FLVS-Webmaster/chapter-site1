            </div>
            <center><p>TSA, or Technology Student Association, is a nationwide competition for students spanning a broad range of interests and passions through a diversity of events. It fosters a love of STEM among students, and provides an environment where they can incorporate their individual skills into a modern context.</p></center>

            <center><h3>Motto:</h3> <p>Learning To Live In A Technical World</p></center>
            <br>
            <center><h3>Creed:</h3> <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p></center>

            <h1 class="heading-title text-center">ABOUT OUR CHAPTER</h1>
            <br>
            <center><p>The TSA chapter at Boiling Springs High School is a Region 3 chapter apart of the Pennsylvania TSA organization.  The chapter meets during a specified resource (study hall) period, and also holds after-school work sessions so members can spend time working on their projects with advisors there to assist them as needed.  The chapter is mainly run by the youth-run officer team, which is elected by the members of the chapter.  Currently this year there are 8 officers.  The advisors are there to help and assist members with their projects and make sure that the chapter is successfully run, but the officer team organizes the meetings and makes sure that they are executed.  Currently, the Boiling Springs HS chapter has a total of 28 registered members.</p></center>

            <br>
            <center><h3>REGIONALS</h3></center>
            <br>
            <center><o>Every year on the first Saturday in February, members of chapters apart of Region 3 come together to compete.  The PA-TSA organization is split into different regions, that have their own conferences.  At Regionals, this is the premilimary round where everyone starts.  Members compete in different events they select, following the event guidelines, here and can qualify to States.</o></center>
            <br>
            <center><h3>STATES</h3></center>
            <br>
            <center><p>If members do well enough at their Regional conference, they can qualify to the State conference.  For Boiling Springs, the minimum requirement to make it to States is either get a first place in at least one (1) event or place top three (3) in at least two events.  The State conference for PA is held at Seven Springs Mountain Resort, outside of Somerset Pennsylvania.</p></center>
            <br>
            <center><h3>NATIONALS</h3></center>
            <br>
            <center><p>Nationals is the top conference members can make it to.  It is difficult to make it to this conference.  In our chapter, less than 3 people will move on from States to Nationals.  The conference is held in a different place every year.  This year it will be held in Nashville, while last year was held in Atlanta.  To make it to Nationals, members must place (getting a 1st place or getting in the top 3) in three (3) events.</p></center>
